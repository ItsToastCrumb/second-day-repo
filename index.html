      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>
        The mascot of Chiitan is based off an actual Asian small-clawed otter of
        the same name. Chiitan was created by the same designer of Shinjo-kun,
        the official otter mascot of Susaki in Japan. Since the real otter was
        named as Susaki's honorary tourism ambassador, Chiitan declared itself
        the unofficial "tourist ambassador."

        Chiitan gained great popularity on Youtube and social media with their
        crazy antics. Their videos and posts would range from learning a new
        skill to outrageous slapstick humor. Some of Chiitan's trademark antics
        include beating up an inflatable punching bag with a baseball bat,
        running at high speeds on a treadmill, and crashing while zooming down a
        slide or street.

      <h2>Controversy</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the citizens of Susaki were unhappy with Chiitan's "reckless"
        stunts and complained that it represented the city poorly. Even though
        it was discovered that the citizens mistook Chiitan for their official
        mascot, Shinjo-kun, the city ended up cutting ties with Chiitan and
        asked that they cease activities. Chiitan's Twitter accounts were then
        suspended although their Instagram account remained active. John Oliver
        even addressed this whole situation on his HBO program and entered into
        a humorous beef with Chiitan.
